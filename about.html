          Welcome! Since you are visiting my website I thought you might
          like to know a little bit about me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Emily Gordon and I am currently a student at <a href = "http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developers Academy</a>.
          Right now we are learning about HTML, and this is my first attempt at a website.
        </p>

          I grew up in the Boston area, and currently live in Seattle, WA. I love to garden, and currently
        have a <a href = "http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/p-patch-community-gardening/about-the-p-patch-program">P-patch</a> community garden up at North Seattle Community College. Here are some of my favorite things to grow:
          <div style="color:#29A329">
            <ul>
              <li>Tomato</li>
              <li>Kale</li>
              <li>Squash</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        I also love to cook and eat delicious food with friends, and explore new places in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.
