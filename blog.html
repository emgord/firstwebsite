        This is not my first time writing a website in HTML, although it has been quite
        a long time. I first started learning html more than 15 years
        ago when I was in 6th grade. My mom was creating a website, and I wanted to have
        one too! She got me started with the basics, and I learned a lot on my own by reading online
        tutorials on how to do lots of fancy things like adding music and
        colors and pop-ups. As I got older I became interested on other things, and I
        haven't written any HTML since then.

        It is really fun and exciting now to come back and learn everything all over again.
        Some things are surprisingly still familiar, however a lot has changed since 1998.
        I am looking forward to learning more and having fun along the way. Come back and check out
        my blog to learn about my journey.
